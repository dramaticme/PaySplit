# 🦧PaySplit – A Secure Bill Splitting App 

PaySplit is a robust backend-driven application designed to simplify and secure the process of managing shared expenses. Whether you're splitting rent with roommates, planning a trip with friends, or organizing group purchases, PaySplit ensures fairness, transparency, and data security for every transaction.

This project focuses on showcasing professional backend development practices, including user authentication, password encryption, role-based access, OAuth2 login (Google), and detailed Swagger API documentation. MySQL is used as the database to ensure data consistency, relational structure, and high performance.

## Features 🚁

1. **User Registration & Login**: Secure signup and login system with password hashing using BCrypt.

2. **Google OAuth2 Authentication**: Users can log in using their Google accounts for added convenience and security.

3. **Role Management**: Supports `ADMIN` and `MEMBER` roles, which can be expanded for authorization-based access control.

4. **Swagger UI Integration**: REST APIs are fully documented and testable through Swagger's interactive interface.

5. **CORS Configuration**: Cross-origin access is enabled and secured for integration with frontend clients.

6. **MySQL Integration**: Stores user data securely using Spring Data JPA with automatic table mapping and constraint enforcement.

7. **Security Best Practices**: CSRF disabled for Swagger testing, cookie handling, and secure HTTP headers are configured.
